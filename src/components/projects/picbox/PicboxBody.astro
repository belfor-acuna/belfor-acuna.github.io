              Picbox was my first web project and it was a great learning experience. I built it using Springboot, MySQL, and Thymeleaf.

              Back in 2023, my team and I won a university hackathon focused on UX/UI design (that's
              where the picture you're seeing was taken). It was a fantastic learning experience and
              a fun challenge. I'm always eager to take on new opportunities to grow and learn.

              Outside of work, Iâ€™m calm and easygoing. I really like tranquility, peaceful
              environments, playing instruments, and I'm always listening to music.

              As you can see, this is me in the picture, that was back in 2023 when my team and I
              won a hackathon of UX/UI design in my university. It was a great experience and I
              learned a lot from it. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow
              and learn new things.
